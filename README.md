Our app name is called __Furry Friend Finder__. Our team use __petfinder api__ to load cat and dog information for pet lovers who would like to adopt. There are input fields for user to enter what kind of cat or dog breed, gender and his or her zip code. When submit, our app will show the breed information, the picture and the contact information for each shelter based on that user's zipcode. For breed information we use the api call from __thecatapi and thedogapi__ to show pictures, size, life span ect. for that specific type at the same time with shelter informaiton. Then our app will call from __mapquest api__ to show the user driving direction and map. In all, we use three type of api calls in this app. 

For the styling and structure, we tried both __Bulma and Materialize.__ 

To summerize: 

Four type of API calls: __Petfinder API, The Cat API, The Dog API and the MapQuest API.__ 

Two frameworks: __Bulma and Materialize.
